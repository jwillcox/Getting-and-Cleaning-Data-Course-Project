# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is to serve as help for the reviewer to know what I did for this project

My repo contains a file run_analysis.R that contains the code I used to complete this project
This code was written after the zip file was already downloaded and unzipped
The initial part of the code pulls in the packages that I used
The subsequent parts of the code have ##comments explaining what each section of code does

There was some level of interpretation that this project allowed for in regards to which variables from the source data to pull into this analsyis regarding the mean and std columnns. I only pulled in columns that ended with either mean() or std().

Another file in this repo is the codebook.
This codebook helps to understand the variables used in the dataset that was submitted.
As a source, I started with the codebooks provided in the zip file and modified them slightly.
